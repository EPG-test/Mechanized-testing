# The Mechanized, Refurbished
An initial attempt to properly rebalance the DeCiv Redux faction "The Mechanized", a faction originally created by [Bamboolord](https://github.com/RealBamboolord) which has since been discontinued due to the inherent difficulty of balancing the faction's gimmick. This rebalance mod is meant to be used in combination with the "Outlaws of the Wastes" expansion mod.
